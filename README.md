# CalcRunPace
First real project - caclulating different stats for running 5Ks, 10K, half, full marathons, or custom distances

Want to publish a web page that will let the end user calculate a missing variable after providing known values.

For example if the end user runs a 5K in 28 minutes 5 seconds, calculate the pace

Formula information

Distance
Time
Pace

pace= distance/time

time = distance/pace

distance = time * pace
